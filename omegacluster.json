This isn't a PvP server, so there's no need to actively attempt to limit another player's enjoyment or path to progression. \r\n\r\nAside from that, there are just a few things we need to cover, mostly building related.\r\n\r\nNo building in artifact caves. I'm 90% sure it's not even possible, but in case I missed that checkbox while setting up the config, please don't.\r\n\r\nPlease do not block off any progression item with your buildings. This means notes, resource nodes for Fabricator+ recipes, etc.\r\n\r\nThis ties back in to the beginning of this panel, but don't be racist, hateful or extremely sexual with your language.\r\n\r\nFinally - no politics in the chat. We get enough of that outside of Ark.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, have fun! Ask questions. Make suggestions. Enjoy yourself to the best of your ability!",
